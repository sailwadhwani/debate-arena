    "recommendation": "Given the consensus that both rice and noodles have unique benefits, it is recommended to promote balanced diets that include elements from both cultures. This can help ensure a diverse and nutritious diet while respecting cultural diversity. Policies and practices should aim to support sustainable agricultural practices for both crops, ensuring their continued availability and promoting dietary habits that balance traditional staples with modern preferences.",
    "reasoning": "The consensus level of 50 reflects the shared understanding that rice and noodles are important staple foods in different regions but acknowledges significant variations in their prevalence. Key agreements include recognizing the nutritional value and cultural significance of both grains. However, there is disagreement on whether one should be considered a global staple food due to varying regional preferences and trends.\n\nThe recommendation synthesizes these viewpoints by advocating for balanced diets that incorporate elements from both cultures while supporting sustainable agricultural practices for rice and noodles. This approach respects the importance of traditional staples without ignoring modern dietary needs or cultural shifts."
