    "reasoning": "The consensus level of 50 indicates that while there are some points of agreement, such as the global importance of rice and noodles, there is still significant disagreement on which food should be considered the staple. This suggests that neither perspective can claim full agreement from all agents. Therefore, a balanced recommendation is made to recognize both foods' significance in different regions without prioritizing one over the other. The recommendation also emphasizes the need for further research into their nutritional value and health impacts to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their roles as staple foods."
